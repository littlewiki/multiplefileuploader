Build:
* Use better names (ant-style names) in the build.xml (dojoVersion should be : dojo.version, host should be : mfu.site.deploy.host, mfuidd should be mfu.idd etc..)
  (make sure to group concepts hierarchically)
* Should not create the build in mfu-${version}.tar.gz but target/mfu-${version}.tar.gz
* some stuff is built in the build/ folder.. everything  should be  in target/
* sme stuff is built in website/_build folder.. everything should be in target/
* we have a Makefile in website/. still useful ???


TODO :

- We should expose an onProgress event to get queue status whenever the user want
-
