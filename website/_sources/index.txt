Multiple files uploader with progress bar using dojotookit framework
 
Introduction
=================

MFU is a JavaScript/AJAX-based file-upload module targetting the dojotoolkit framework.
It enables user to have straightforward and really easy to use file uploader onto his web application.

Pre-requisite :
==================

**Multiple File Uploader with a static progress bar**

* A browser with javascript enabled
* dojotoolkit >= 1.2


**Multiple File Uploader with a shiny determinated progress bar indicator**

* php case : If you want to have a shiny progress bar, you need to enable php_apc extension as php doesnt have built-in method to monitor upload.
* other : ...


**Client-Server RESTful protocol :**

Here is a standard flow showing how does it works

.. image:: _static/upload.png


our PHP library provides the ability to upload  image to a remote pymager instance
If you dont want to forward file to pymager, leave upload_to = "local_directory"

Have a look in upload.conf::

  [general]
  ;upload_to = "pymager"
  upload_to = "local_directory"

  [local]
  upload_parameter_name = "upload"
  upload_folder_name = "uploadedFiles"

  [remote]
  host = "127.0.0.1"
  port =  "8000"
  pymager_upload_parameter_name = "file"
  user = "test"
  password = "test"
  proxy_url = ""
  proxy_port = ""


When upload_to = "pymager" is specified, php will upload the file according to the [remote] configuration section


Installation when NOT using progress bar indicator
=====================================================

 **Server side**
 
For this part, you dont need any server side configuration.You just need a folder with write right to indicate php or other where to upload files.

 **client side**
 
* Download the zip and extract files into your webapp folder.
* Put the following line in the head : <script type="text/javascript" src="mfu.js"/>

	.. code-block:: javascript
	
		var params = { 
			ajaxUploadUrl: "http://localhost/multiplefileuploader/php/upload.php"
		};
		var upload = new multiplefileuploader.widget.MultipleFileUploader( params , dojo.byId("uploadContainer") ); 	
		

* Have a look to sample.html

Installation when using progress bar indicator
====================================================

**server side**

A sample PHP implementation is provided at your convenience. Feel free to contribute patches and other server-side implementations.

*for Linux* :

Enable/add php_apc extension in php.ini as php doesnt have built-in method to monitor upload::

  extension=apc.so

*for Windows* ::

  extension=php_apc.dll

Next, APC feature which monitors file uploads has to be enable. To do so, the apc.rfc1867 setting must be switched to On in php.ini::

  apc.rfc1867 = On

Dont forget to restart your webserver and make sure your changes have been successfully saved by checking with :

	.. code-block:: php
	
	 <?
		phpinfo();
	  ?> 

**client side**

In MultipleFileUploader.js
progressBarMode : true
apc_php_enabled : true

When you instanciate mfu widget, you have to pass uploadAjaxURL as well as uploadStatusURL like in the sample :

	.. code-block:: javascript
	
		var params = { 
			ajaxUploadUrl: "http://localhost/multiplefileuploader/php/upload.php", 
			uploadStatusURL : "http://localhost/multiplefileuploader/php/status.php" 
		};
		var upload = new multiplefileuploader.widget.MultipleFileUploader( params , dojo.byId("uploadContainer") ); 	

Packages
====================

we provide you one package including different mfu version :

**mfu-dojo-embedded :** 
This package is used when you dont have dojo framework in your webapp. dojo/dijit/dojox and mfu are included in one js file.

**mfu-including-dijit-dojox-dependencies :**
This package provides two js file. dojo.js, which is a common dojo.js , and mfu.js in layer folder which includes dijit, dojox, and mfu dependencies in one file.

**mfu-src :**
This package is mfu sources including units tests. We really advise you to build mfu using dojo build system ( in order to include mfu in your dojo.js ) for performance. As a matter of fact, you will only have one GET for all your widgets dependencies.


how to connect MFU events to your application
===============================================

You probably want to connect your application to the different upload steps. MFU has several events which can be connected

	.. code-block:: javascript
	
		/* triggered when a NETWORK error occured */
		 onError : function() {
		 }, 	 
		/* triggered when all the files in queue are uploaded */		 
		 onFinishedUploads : function() {
		 },	 
		/* triggered when a file is uploaded */
		 onFinishedUpload : function(uploadedFileInformation) { 	
		 },	
		/* triggered when a file is being uploaded */ 
		 onAfterUploadStart : function(uploadRequest) {
		 },
		 /* TO CHECK 
		 fireProgress : function() {
		 }
	 
	 
Example :
	.. code-block:: javascript
	
		dojo.connect(upload, 'onFinishedUpload', function(uploadedFileInformation) {
			//Here your code when a file is uploaded
		});

upload var is an mfu instance.
